// This file previously contained TypeScript interfaces.
// In a client-side transpilation environment without a build step,
// these type definitions are stripped out, and importing them can cause
// runtime errors if the file becomes empty after transpilation.
// All type annotations have been removed from the application code
// to ensure compatibility with this setup.
